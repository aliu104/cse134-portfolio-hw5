        description="I have been a tutor for CSE 12 Basic Data Structures, one of the most foundational CS courses at UC San Diego, for approaching three years. As a tutor, I have supported and guided nearly 2500 students through fostering good coding practices like clean code, debugging skills, and visualizing concepts, helping students build a strong base for their future coursework. Witnessing their progress and receiving positive feedback confirmed that my individualized teaching approach and patience made a meaningful impact.">
